            <p>Freedom of the press is a right enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution. However, it has
                been
                challenged time and time again in the United States. Free press has been under threat for years, and
                President Trump is at the forefront. Trump’s war on the news media has free press in jeopardy.

            <h2>The Background</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>In 2025, the United States ranked #57 out of 180 countries in the <a
                        href="https://rsf.org/en/country/united-states">Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom
                        Index.
                    </a> This is a two place decrease from its rank of #55 in 2024, and twelve places below
                    its rank
                    of #45 in 2023. This is the lowest ranking the U.S. has received since appearing in the index.
                    United States first appeared in the index in 2013. A country’s ranking in the index is determined by
                    the
                    “ability of journalists as individuals and collectives to select, produce, and disseminate news in
                    the
                    public interest independent of political, economic, legal, and social interference and in the
                    absence of
                    threats to their physical and mental safety,” according to RSF.

                <p>In the past year, Democrats have become more concerned about press freedom than Republicans. In 2024,
                    47%
                    of
                    Republicans and right-leaning Americans were concerned about press freedoms, while only 38% of
                    Democrats
                    and
                    left-leaning Americans were. In 2025, 60% of Democrats are concerned about press freedoms, while
                    only
                    28% of
                    Republicans are. This change came along with the shift from the Biden Administration to the Trump
                    Administration from 2024 to 2025.
                </p>
                <p> Along with that, in 2024, Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe that the media was
                    completely free to report the news. In 2025, Republicans are more likely to say this than Democrats.

                <p>In the past six months, the U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has recorded six “chilling statements”

                    to
                    the Trump Administration. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker defines chilling statements as “select
                    public
                    threats made to reporters and media organizations by U.S. politicians and other public figures.”

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Judging by the course of President Trump’s first 100 days of his second term, he is unlikely to end
                    his
                    war
                    on the press any time soon. The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker has recorded 23 incidents of journalists
                    being
                    targeted so far in 2025, and this number will only grow.
                </p>
                <p>According to the Reporter’s Committee for the Freedom of the Press, the best way to support press
                    freedom
                    is
                    to stay informed and demand government transparency. Today’s political climate may need that now
                    more
                    than
                    ever.
